Disposition 0.8:

	* Now Disposition is compiled as a library, so you can link it
	  with your program more easily.

	* Type PermutationCRep is now better tested, fixed and complete.
	  However, the "restricted" repetition types are not finished yet.

	* Added program lc (like program wc) for counting dispositions
	  on non-UNIX systems.

	* API change: Removed the macro disp_end() to simplify the library.
	  The old loop:  for (disp_first(d); !disp_end(d); disp_next(d)) {...}
	  now should be: for (disp_first(d), c = 1; c; c = disp_next(d)) {...}
	  or simply:     disp_first(d); do { ... } while (disp_next(d));

	* Now a single Disposition structure can be shared between many
	  different vectors of the correct size, to save memory for example.

	* The Makefile has options to install the library in /usr/local.
