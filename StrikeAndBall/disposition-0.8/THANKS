Thanks to David Hernandez Sobrino (dhernandez@prointec.es) for help me
to find the way to generate random combinations with repetition.

Thanks to Guillermo Martinez Jimenez (gmjimen@burdjia.com) for explaining
me in detail how to create a better file structure for the program and
its corresponding Makefile.

Thanks to Maria Pilar de las Heras Gonzalez (pilarh@ubu.es), who help
me when I ask her about combinations with repetition, many years ago,
when I was thinking about the first version of this program.

Also, thanks to the free software community and the GNU project for
support all those programs that I need to use in my daily work: Linux,
X-Window, GCC, GNOME, KDE, Mozilla Firefox, Perl, bash, etc.
